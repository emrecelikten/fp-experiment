# fp-experiment
A simple Scala experiment for learning about some functional programming concepts.

The goal is to build something that combines the results of some IO operations, transforms them and then outputs them, using FP tools such as monads.

We will be using the book "Functional Programming in Scala" as a reference. (More information: http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/)
